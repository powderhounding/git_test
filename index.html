        <h1>Welcome to Big Bear's Den</h1>
        <img src="images/Bear-with-fish.png" alt="Big Bear and his Fish">   
    
    <P>Big Bear is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, unless he has a fish to eat.</p>

    <p>In addition to eating fish, Big Bear also likes to eat:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="images/berries.png">Berries</a></li>
            <li><a href="images/honey.jpg">Honey</a></li>
            <li>Small Critters</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Big Bear sleeps a lot, and eats a lot. He's actually a really nice bear, all things considered, but has gotten a bad rap due to his size and those big claws.  He's a bear, give him a break!</p>
